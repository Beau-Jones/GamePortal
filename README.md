# TODO


- "LoginButton" successfully redirects to Steam to log in with Steam profile, but we still need to replace the button with their Steam profile and icon and logout button, as well as handle all the backend stuff happening during this time.

- Gear, selection option on post to delete post.
- Fix the white that is added to the bottom of the screen when posts cause more scrolling. Ian seems to have this issue on CX too.
